# Stage 1

In this stage your task will be to design and implement

- a model of vehicle dynamics (which includes a state space and an action space).
- an observation space for the agent
- a reward function

Since this task could be very challenging for students, collaboration is highly encouraged!

You need to create a new python file in `src/env/` for the new environment. The environment should inherit from `BaseEnv`. You can name it `robotaxi.py`, but it's up to you.

What is expected:

- Actions: acceleration and steering angle
- Forces: friction etc

Test the environment using the renderer as shown in `src/main.py`.

Further details will be provided later and upon request.
